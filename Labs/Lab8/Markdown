At first, I approached this problem with my own version of brute force.
It made sense to me that, logically, you would go backwards from the 
coin array, subtracting the biggest number, then smaller numbers if 
your target number is less than the amount on the coin. This gave a
simple potential real-life application answer, but it failed some test
cases. For example, if we had coins 1, 3, 4, 5, and the target was
7, my code would provide 3 when the correct answer would be 2. My 
code would have looked at 5, 1, 1. I was quite stumped for a while, 
but then I watched a YouTube video. After thoroughly making sure that 
I understood the algorithm, and after a break, I coded it myself 
in Java and Python.
