# CS146 HW 9

I first analyzed the given functions and definitions. Then I checked for empty root or
if the root was equal to p or q. This is because if the root was empty, the recursive path
was 'over' and if it was equal to p or q, then it was the common ancestor. Then I checked down
the left and right paths of the tree and if both returned some node, then that node was the
LCA. I finished by building trees and testing my function

Quick note: for the following java assingments, the TreeNode class will not be defined
because I am creating all of these assingments as different classes on one project to 
better organize my IDE
