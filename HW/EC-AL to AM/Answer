# Given an adjacency list, how can you convert it to an adjacency matrix?
First, you would find the amount of verticies inside the adjacnecy list so 
that you have a number to create an nxn matrix, then you would go through the 
adjacency list, the current vertex, or your key would be i and the vertex 
being traveled to or the value, would be j. Using these, you would iterate 
through the list and fill the matrix with [i][j]. You can fill the matrix at 
[i][j] with 1 for unweighted and the weight for weighted graphs, make sure to
fill in matrix[j][i] in the case of undirected graphs.

# Given a directed graph, how can you reverse the direction of each edge?
