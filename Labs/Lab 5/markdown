# Lab 5

Similar to lab 4, I recursively checked if each left node was less than the current node
and the right was greater than the current node. However, this would not satisfy the 
definition of a binary search tree. I learned in class that we needed to implement an
upper and lower bounds for each node within the binary search tree. So I implemented a
function to do so within each recursive call. I coded it in java, then translated
to python.
