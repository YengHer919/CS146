# CS146 HW 8

To solve this problem, I implemented a counting sort-like algorithm to count the number 
of times each character appeared in a string. I used a hashmap to store and index everything.
I then counted out the biggest odd number of characters (there can only be one in the 
palindrome). Then I returned the sum of the biggest odd number of characters and all of the
even numbers for both python and java.
