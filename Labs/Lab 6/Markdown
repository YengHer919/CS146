For this problem, I recognized that we needed to check for cycles and that the best way to do that
was to emulate topological sorting. I tried to implement a part of Kahn's, iterating through the 
graph starting from one node and keeping track of all the nodes that I had already visted inside of 
an array. For each node, I would recursively check the entire tree if any path of nodes would lead back
to a node that had been visted. If the recursive function found a cycle, it would return true, otherwise
it would return false, inidicating a lack of cycles and the ability to complete all the classes.
