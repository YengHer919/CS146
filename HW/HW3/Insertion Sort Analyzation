This is an insertion sort code from GeeksForGeeks.com

 /*Function to sort array using insertion sort*/
    void sort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i - 1;
 
            /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
               greater than key, to one position ahead
               of their current position */
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }

Insertion sort has a while loop nested within a for loop which iterates over the entire list
Best case (the list is already sorted), insertion sort has O(N) runtime, however, in every other
case, the while loop will run as many times as needed until the element is sorted. The while loop
runs at an average of N time. Being nested within a loop on N times makes the while loop and the 
overall algorithm O(N^2).
