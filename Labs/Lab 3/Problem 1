1. 10000000000n^2 vs. n^3
  n3 would be greater asymptotically, if the n is greater than 10000000000, n3 will grow faster. Note that the bigger exponent will always outgrow the smaller one


2. n^2log(n) vs. n(log(n))10
  n^2log(n) would be greater asymptotically. When the log rules are applied, n(log(n))10 would become 10n(log(n). The 10 from the outside goes to the front when 
  applying log properties. After analyzing both, the first one is bigger because the n is being squared while the second is just n


3. nlogn vs. 2^√n
  2^√n would be greater asymptotically because it is an exponent that is ever growing
  nlogn = logn(logn) = log((logn)2) = 2(log(logn)) is generally slower than an exponent
  

4. 2n vs. 2^2n
  2^2n would be greater asymptotically because 2 is greater than 2n
